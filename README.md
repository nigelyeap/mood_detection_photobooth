This is a Electron app that acts as a photobooth. It uses a face-api.js model to detect the mood of the subjects of the photobooth, and assigns a mood and filter accordingly. 
The moods include happy, sad, angry,surprised, etc. 
Individual filters such as black and white, sepia, inverted etc can also be enabled.
