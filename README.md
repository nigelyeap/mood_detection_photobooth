This photobooth application is built using Electron, coded with node js for the UI and face-api js for the AI.

This photobooth app is functionable as a regular photobooth app, complete with filters, a photobooth mode that takes 4 photos and puts it on a filmstrip, a singular photo mode, etc.

It also has the functionality of mood detection based on live feedback from the webcam, which is a feature I will develop more into in the future.

Ultimately, this was a project just for me to hone my skills in node js and prepare myself for the use of javascript in AI implementation in my future.
I have never coded with node js or even javascript before, do give advice if possible!
